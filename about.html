      <p>
          Ben Rempel is a percussionist and composer working in and between many kinds of music including free improvisation, jazz and creative music, contemporary percussion repertoire, classical music, Brazilian music, and experimental rock. His original work doesn’t fit a well-defined label (but whose does these days?), existing somewhere in the intersections of these and other influences.
      </p>
      <p>
          Ben has performed with Peter Evans, Anthony Davis, Glen Velez, percussion ensemble red fish blue fish, and the Hawaii Symphony Orchestra; and has premiered pieces by George Lewis, Thomas Meadowcroft, and Adam Rudolph. A frequent interdisciplinary collaborator, he has co-composed and performed in several dance productions. He is a co-founder and former Artistic Director of The Syndicate for the New Arts, a new music ensemble and non-profit organization in Cleveland, OH.
      </p>

          Ben has a master’s degree from UC San Diego where he studied with Steven Schick, and a bachelor’s degree from Oberlin College. Now he lives in Los Angeles.
